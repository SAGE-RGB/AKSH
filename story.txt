The biggest problem Indian youth faced, I felt, was a lack of clarity 
of vision, a lack of direction. It was then that I decided to write 
about the circumstances and people who made me what I am today; the 
idea was not merely to pay tribute to some individuals or highlight
certain aspects of my life. What I wanted to say was that no one, 
however poor, underprivileged or small, need feel disheartened about life. 
Problems are a part of life. Suffering is the essence of success.
As someone said:

God has not promised
Skies always blue,
Flower-strewn pathways
All our life through;
God has not promised
Sun without rain,
Joy without sorrow,
Peace without pain
